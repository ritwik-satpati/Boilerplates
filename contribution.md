## Adding new Boilerplate
- Fork the [Git Repo]()
- Clone your own forked git repo
- Create New File/Directory with proper name with all smallcase and separated by hyphen
    - like `nodejs-expressjs-mongodb-esmodule` or `nodejs-expressjs-mongodb-multiple-connection-esmodule`
- `Package name` or `Project name` should be same as folder name 
- Make sure all blank folder/directoty containing `.gitkeep`
- Create `.gitignore` file inside your new boilerplate folder to avoid uploading unnecessary file or folder. Use [online .gitignore generator](https://mrkandreev.name/snippets/gitignore-generator/)
- Create proper `setup.md` file inside your new boilerplate folder for setup steps
- Create `FileStructure.txt` file inside your new boilerplate folder for boilerplate File Structure details
    - See example: [nodejs-expressjs-mongodb-esmodule's FileStructure.txt](./nodejs-expressjs-mongodb-esmodule/FileStructure.txt)
- Create `README.md` file inside your new boilerplate folder for boilerplate's additional details include features, utilized technologies, as well as libraries and packages.
    - See example: [nodejs-expressjs-mongodb-esmodule's README.md](./nodejs-expressjs-mongodb-esmodule/README.md)
- Code files must have clear comments for understanding and maintenance 
- Push to your forked git repo
- Pull Request with proper 
    - Name: `#New_Boilerplate - <name>` (Example: `#New_Boilerplate - nodejs-expressjs-mongodb-esmodule-cloudinary`)
    - Description: Short description of the boilerplate

## Note: 
- We recommend creating and requesting to pull a new tech or commonly used feature's boilerplate template crafted by yourself rather than using similar templates or copying others' boilerplates.
- No one can claim copyright ownership after adding a new boilerplate. However, they can add credits in the `README.md` file.
- All types of promotion and marketing are prohibited.
